# About the Talk

In this talk, I would like to take a phenomenological approach to the investigation of my 25+ years of experience writing computer code as a means of composing music and generating musical experience. In so doing, I will touch on a range of topics - including Code as Prosthesis, Lisp (List Processing), Sp/ARC (Specification and Audiation in Real-Time Composition), and Composing in the Continuum – and attempt to integrate this ‘dog’s breakfast’ within a wholistic experience that is rooted in – or at least related to - Taoist philosophy.
