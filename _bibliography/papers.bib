abstract = {We present SensaBubble, a chrono-sensory mid-air display system that generates scented bubbles to deliver information to the user via a number of sensory modalities. The system reliably produces single bubbles of specific sizes along a directed path. Each bubble produced by SensaBubble is filled with fog containing a scent relevant to the notification. The chrono-sensory aspect of SensaBubble means that information is presented both temporally and multimodally. Temporal information is enabled through two forms of persistence: firstly, a visual display projected onto the bubble which only endures until it bursts; secondly, a scent released upon the bursting of the bubble slowly disperses and leaves a longer-lasting perceptible trace of the event. We report details of SensaBubble's design and implementation, as well as results of technical and user evaluations. We then discuss and demonstrate how SensaBubble can be adapted for use in a wide range of application contexts -- from an ambient peripheral display for persistent alerts, to an engaging display for gaming or education.},

ABSTRACT={<p>The field of environmental enrichment for zoo animals, particularly great apes, has been revived by technological advancements such as touchscreen interfaces and motion sensors. However, direct animal-computer interaction (ACI) is impractical or undesirable for many zoos. We developed a modular cuboid puzzle maze for the troop of six Western lowland gorillas (<italic>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</italic>) at Bristol Zoo Gardens, United Kingdom. The gorillas could use their fingers or tools to interact with interconnected modules and remove food rewards. Twelve modules could be interchanged within the frame to create novel iterations with every trial. We took a screen-free approach to enrichment: substituting ACI for tactile, physically complex device components, in addition to hidden automatic sensors, and cameras to log device use. The current study evaluated the gorillas’ behavioral responses to the device, and evaluated it as a form of “cognitive enrichment.” Five out of six gorillas used the device, during monthly trials of 1 h duration, over a 6 month period. All users were female including two infants, and there were significant individual differences in duration of device use. The successful extraction of food rewards was only performed by the three tool-using gorillas. Device use did not diminish over time, and gorillas took turns to use the device alone or as one mother-infant dyad. Our results suggest that the device was a form of cognitive enrichment for the study troop because it allowed gorillas to solve novel challenges, and device use was not associated with behavioral indicators of stress or frustration. However, device exposure had no significant effects on gorilla activity budgets. The device has the potential to be a sustainable enrichment method in the long-term, tailored to individual gorilla skill levels and motivations. Our study represents a technological advancement for gorilla enrichment, an area which had been particularly overlooked until now. We wholly encourage the continued development of this physical maze system for other great apes under human care, with or without computer logging technology.</p>},

EchoSnap explores how an audio feedback loop created between a mobile device's microphone and speaker can be used to playfully explore and probe the resonant characteristics of hollow objects, using the resulting sounds to control a mobile device. With PlayableAle, the tone made by blowing across the top of a bottle is used as a method of controlling a game. The work presented in this paper builds upon our previous work exploring the concept of resonant bits, where digital information is given resonant properties that can be explored through physical interaction. In particular, this paper expands upon the concept by looking at resonance in the physical as opposed to digital domain. Using EchoSnap and PlayableAle to illustrate we present a preliminary design space for structuring the continuing development of audible resonant interaction.},

How can tangible interfaces be used in an indirect or peripheral manner to aid storytelling? Can miniature landscapes aid recollection and story telling through embodied interaction? Are ambiguous depictions conducive to storytelling? Can topographic tangibles encourage inclusivity in group sharing situations?

We present the iterative process of developing this interface, spanning technical explorations, prototyping and a user study. We report lessons learnt when designing the interface; ranging from the soap film mixture to the impact of frames and apertures. We then describe developing the touch, push, pull and pop interactions. Our user study shows how FugaciousFilm led to focused and attentive interactions during a tournament of enhanced Tic-Tac-Toe. We then finish by discussing how the principles of vulnerability and delicacy can motivate the design of attentive ephemeral interfaces.},

abstract = {This paper presents the concept of Resonant Bits, an interaction technique for encouraging engaging, slow and skilful interaction with tangible, mobile and ubiquitous devices. The technique is based on the resonant excitation of harmonic oscillators and allows the exploration of a number of novel types of tangible interaction including: ideomotor control, where subliminal micro-movements accumulate over time to produce a visible outcome; indirect tangible interaction, where a number of devices can be controlled simultaneously through an intermediary object such as a table; and slow interaction, with meditative and repetitive gestures being used for control. The Resonant Bits concept is tested as an interaction method in a study where participants resonate with virtual pendulums on a mobile device. The Harmonic Tuner, a resonance-based music player, is presented as a simple example of using resonant bits. Overall, our ambition in proposing the Resonant Bits concept is to promote skilful, engaging and ultimately rewarding forms of interaction with tangible devices that takes time and patience to learn and master.},

abstract = {Capturing data is a key part of archaeological practice, whether for preserving records or to aid interpretation. But the technologies used are complex and expensive, resulting in time-consuming processes associated with their use. These processes force a separation between ongoing interpretive work and capture. Through two field studies we elicit more detail as to what is important about this interpretive work and what might be gained through a closer integration of capture technology with these practices. Drawing on these insights, we go on to present a novel, portable, wireless 3D modeling system that emphasizes "quick and dirty" capture. We discuss its design rational in relation to our field observations and evaluate this rationale further by giving the system to archaeological experts to explore in a variety of settings. While our device compromises on the resolution of traditional 3D scanners, its support of interpretation through emphasis on real-time capture, review and manipulability suggests it could be a valuable tool for the future of archaeology.},

abstract = {Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) represent digital information via a number of sensory modalities including the haptic, visual and auditory senses. We suggest that interaction with tangible interfaces is commonly governed primarily through visual cues, despite the emphasis on tangible representation. We do not doubt that visual feedback offers rich interaction guidance, but argue that emphasis on haptic and auditory feedback could support or substitute vision in situations of visual distraction or impairment. We have developed a series of simple TUIs that allows for the haptic and auditory exploration of visually hidden textures. Our technique is to transmit the force feedback of the texture to the user via the attraction of a ball bearing to a magnet that the user manipulates. This allows the detail of the texture to be presented to the user while visually presenting an entirely flat surface. The use of both opaque and transparent materials allows for controlling the texture visibility for comparative purposes. The resulting Feelable User Interface (FUI), shown in Fig. 1, allows for the exploration of which textures and structures are useful for haptic guidance. The findings of our haptic exploration shall provide basic understanding about the usage of haptic cues for interacting with tangible objects that are visually hidden or are in the user's visual periphery.},

We use the ChronoTape to interrogate the value relationships between physical and digital materials, personal and professional practices, and the ways that records are produced, maintained and ultimately inherited. In contrast to designs that support existing genealogical practice, ChronoTape captures and embeds traces of the researcher within the document of their own research, in three ways: (i) it ensures physical traces of digital research; (ii) it generates personal material around the use of impersonal genealogical data; (iii) it allows for graceful degradation of both its physical and digital components in order to deliberately accommodate the passage of information into the future.},

abstract = {eHealth research employing technology and HCI to support wellbeing, recovery and maintenance of conditions, has seen significant progress in recent years. However, such research has primarily focused on mobile "apps" running on commercial smartphones. We believe that Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) offer many physical and interaction qualities that would benefit the eHealth community. Yet, there is little research that combines the two. Tangibles for Health will bring together leading researchers in tangible user interaction and health to explore the potential of tangibles as applied to healthcare and wellbeing.},

	abstract = { This article retraces the history of telematic performance from early videophone experiments by the Electronic Café in the 1980s, through a series of ambitious digital art installations at museums like the Centre Pompidou. Onto this history, I map a series of netmusic projects I initiated in this period, from ISDN performances at the Sonar Festival to my installation Global String at Ars Electronica. This sets the context for collaborative online performances held during the COVID pandemic with artists like Paul Sermon and the Chicks on Speed. I finish by describing the Hybrid Live project connecting Goldsmiths and Iklectik Art Labs in London with Stanford University’s CCRMA and SFJazz in California. I describe the low latency audio transport used, the importance of audiovisual synchronisation and the computer vision abstractions resulting in a London-New York remote dance performance. By situating current work in these histories, and closely examining the qualities of the network necessary for the transmission of a sense of embodied experience – and therefore trust – we understand that network performance occurs in its own space, one distinct from physical co-presence. },

	abstract = {This article presents a custom system combining hardware and software that senses physiological signals of the performer's body resulting from muscle contraction and translates them to computer-synthesized sound. Our goal was to build upon the history of research in the field to develop a complete, integrated system that could be used by nonspecialist musicians. We describe the Embodied AudioVisual Interaction Electromyogram, an end-to-end system spanning wearable sensing on the musician's body, custom microcontroller-based biosignal acquisition hardware, machine learning–based gesture-to-sound mapping middleware, and software-based granular synthesis sound output. A novel hardware design digitizes the electromyogram signals from the muscle with minimal analog preprocessing and treats it in an audio signal-processing chain as a class-compliant audio and wireless MIDI interface. The mapping layer implements an interactive machine learning workflow in a reinforcement learning configuration and can map gesture features to auditory metadata in a multidimensional information space. The system adapts existing machine learning and synthesis modules to work with the hardware, resulting in an integrated, end-to-end system. We explore its potential as a digital musical instrument through a series of public presentations and concert performances by a range of musical practitioners.},
