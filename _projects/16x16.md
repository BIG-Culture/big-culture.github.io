16×16 is an interactive installation exploring computer-aided creativity through an esoteric audio-visual platform. Typing on a keyboard, a series of novel grid-based music environments can be investigated, with machine-learning generated prompts encouraging creative play.

The piece looks at how constraints and meaningful minimalist interaction can foster creativity, focusing on how machine-learning interventions can become a valuable part of the creative process. How much musical fun can you have with only a 16×16 grid? Can simple technology lead to deep interaction and flow? Can you make complex music with minimalist, yet meaningful systems? And, does collaboration with whimsical machine-learning aid creativity?
