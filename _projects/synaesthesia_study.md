Our research aims to explore the realm of communication surrounding synaesthesia: investigating how technology could support communication for synaesthetes (individuals who acknowledge their synaesthesia) and enable non-synaesthetes (individuals who have not acknowledged their synaesthesia) to explore and articulate their sensory experiences.
We first conducted an interview study to understand the experience of synaesthesia, particularly its associated challenges and benefits.
Based on these insights, we are currently conducting a workshop study with UK-based synaesthetes. If you are interested in participating in the workshop study, please contact Mamoru Watanabe at mamoru.watanabe@bristol.ac.uk
