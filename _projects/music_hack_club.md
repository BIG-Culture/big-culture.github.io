Come and make some noise in the MVB hackspace! This is weekly informal meet up to play, tinker, and develop and new musical instruments and sound making devices. Think modular synthesisers, circuit-bent toys, novel controllers and laser-cut percussion. We'll be exploring physical materials, using microcontrollers (Arduino, Teensy, Pico) whilst exploring audio software such as Pure Data, MaxMSP and Ableton with dives into esoteric live coding. The aims are to share skills, have fun and make some noise!

Usual meeting time is Wednesday afternoons 3-5pm
